\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \code{\link[ggplot2:aes]{aes()}}. If specified and
\code{inherit.aes = TRUE} (the default), it is combined with the default mapping
at the top level of the plot. You must supply \code{mapping} if there is no plot
mapping.}

\item{data}{The data to be displayed in this layer. There are three
options:

If \code{NULL}, the default, the data is inherited from the plot
data as specified in the call to \code{\link[ggplot2:ggplot]{ggplot()}}.

A \code{data.frame}, or other object, will override the plot
data. All objects will be fortified to produce a data frame. See
\code{\link[ggplot2:fortify]{fortify()}} for which variables will be created.

A \code{function} will be called with a single argument,
the plot data. The return value must be a \code{data.frame}, and
will be used as the layer data. A \code{function} can be created
from a \code{formula} (e.g. \code{~ head(.x, 10)}).}

\item{geom}{The geometric object to use to display the data, either as a
\code{ggproto} \code{Geom} subclass or as a string naming the geom stripped of the
\code{geom_} prefix (e.g. \code{"point"} rather than \code{"geom_point"})}

\item{position}{Position adjustment, either as a string naming the adjustment
(e.g. \code{"jitter"} to use \code{position_jitter}), or the result of a call to a
position adjustment function. Use the latter if you need to change the
settings of the adjustment.}

\item{n}{The number of points to create for each segment}

\item{strength}{The proportion to move the control point along the x-axis
towards the other end of the bezier curve}

\item{na.rm}{If \code{FALSE}, the default, missing values are removed with
a warning. If \code{TRUE}, missing values are silently removed.}

\item{orientation}{The orientation of the layer. The default (\code{NA})
automatically determines the orientation from the aesthetic mapping. In the
rare event that this fails it can be given explicitly by setting \code{orientation}
to either \code{"x"} or \code{"y"}. See the \emph{Orientation} section for more detail.}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped.
\code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.
It can also be a named logical vector to finely select the aesthetics to
display.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics,
rather than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions
that define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from
the default plot specification, e.g. \code{\link[ggplot2:borders]{borders()}}.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed on to \code{\link[ggplot2:layer]{layer()}}. These are
often aesthetics, used to set an aesthetic to a fixed value, like
\code{colour = "red"} or \code{size = 3}. They may also be parameters
to the paired geom/stat.}

\item{stat}{The statistical transformation to use on the data for this
layer, either as a \code{ggproto} \code{Geom} subclass or as a string naming the
stat stripped of the \code{stat_} prefix (e.g. \code{"count"} rather than
\code{"stat_count"})}

\item{arrow}{Arrow specification, as created by \code{\link[grid:arrow]{grid::arrow()}}.}

\item{lineend}{Line end style (round, butt, square).}
}
\description{
A diagonal is a bezier curve where the control points are moved
perpendicularly towards the center in either the x or y direction a fixed
amount. The versions provided here calculates horizontal diagonals meaning
that the x coordinate is moved to achieve the control point. The
\code{geom_diagonal()} and \code{stat_diagonal()} functions are simply helpers that
takes care of calculating the position of the control points and then
forwards the actual bezier calculations to \code{\link[=geom_bezier]{geom_bezier()}}.
}
\section{Aesthetics}{

geom_diagonal and geom_diagonal0 understand the following aesthetics
(required aesthetics are in bold):
\itemize{
\item \strong{x}
\item \strong{y}
\item \strong{xend}
\item \strong{yend}
\item color
\item linewidth
\item linetype
\item alpha
\item lineend
}

geom_diagonal2 understand the following aesthetics
(required aesthetics are in bold):
\itemize{
\item \strong{x}
\item \strong{y}
\item \strong{group}
\item color
\item linewidth
\item linetype
\item alpha
\item lineend
}
}

\section{Computed variables}{


\describe{
\item{x, y}{The interpolated point coordinates}
\item{index}{The progression along the interpolation mapped between 0 and 1}
}
}

\section{Orientation}{


This geom treats each axis differently and, thus, can thus have two orientations. Often the orientation is easy to deduce from a combination of the given mappings and the types of positional scales in use. Thus, ggplot2 will by default try to guess which orientation the layer should have. Under rare circumstances, the orientation is ambiguous and guessing may fail. In that case the orientation can be specified directly using the \code{orientation} parameter, which can be either \code{"x"} or \code{"y"}. The value gives the axis that the geom should run along, \code{"x"} being the default orientation you would expect for the geom.

\examples{
data <- data.frame(
  x = rep(0, 10),
  y = 1:10,
  xend = 1:10,
  yend = 2:11
)

ggplot(data) +
  geom_diagonal(aes(x, y, xend = xend, yend = yend))

# The standard version provides an index to create gradients
ggplot(data) +
  geom_diagonal(aes(x, y, xend = xend, yend = yend, alpha = after_stat(index)))

# The 0 version uses bezierGrob under the hood for an approximation
ggplot(data) +
  geom_diagonal0(aes(x, y, xend = xend, yend = yend))

# The 2 version allows you to interpolate between endpoint aesthetics
data2 <- data.frame(
  x = c(data$x, data$xend),
  y = c(data$y, data$yend),
  group = rep(1:10, 2),
  colour = sample(letters[1:5], 20, TRUE)
)
ggplot(data2) +
  geom_diagonal2(aes(x, y, group = group, colour = colour))

# Use strength to control the steepness of the central region
ggplot(data, aes(x, y, xend = xend, yend = yend)) +
  geom_diagonal(strength = 0.75, colour = 'red') +
  geom_diagonal(strength = 0.25, colour = 'blue')
